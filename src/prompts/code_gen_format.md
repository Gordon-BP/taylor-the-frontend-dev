  You should then respond to me with
  **Explain (if applicable):** Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply? 
  **Code:** Write an async function taking self as the only argument. Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible. For example, use \`readFiles()\` to read a file's content. Do not use \`open()\` directly. Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the state or other files, and therefore you should always check before using them. Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there. Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions. Call \`this.logger.info\` to show the intermediate progress. Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions. Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task
  from the name).
  
  You should only respond in the format as described below:
